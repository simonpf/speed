# The IPWG Satellite Precipitation Estimation Evaluation Dataset (SPEED)

The Satellite Precipitation Estimation Evaluation Dataset (SPEED) has been
developed by the International Precipitation Working Group (IPWG) to serve as a
benchmark dataset for precipitation retrievals. The dataset consists of
collocations of various space-borne passive microwave sensors with reference
precipitation measurements from ground-based and space-borne active sensors.

The dataset aims to serve two principal applications:
    1. The rapid benchmarking of precipitation retrieval algorithms
    2. The validation of operational precipitation retrieval algorithms
